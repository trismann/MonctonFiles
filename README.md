## Moncton/Gander FIR Sector Files

### About
Enhanced Sector Files for the Virtual Moncton/Gander FIR. These are designed to be compatible with all other sector file varations and the VATCANSitu Plugin.
Main changes include redrawn .asr files, cleaned up .sct/.ese files, realistic radar coverage, and updated ground screens.

### Installation
It is recomended to have the default CanScope/EuroScope settings files installed with a separate profile as to not conflict with other files that may be saved. Use the following to get the file setup.

1. Download the source code zip file from the [latest release](https://github.com/trismann/MonctonFiles/releases). 

1. Click `Open SCT` then click `Open...`, find the `CZQM.sct` file and open.

1. Under the `Other SET` menu, load the following files under `Settings files setup` (located in the settings folder): CZQM LiveATC, CZQM Login Profiles, and CZQM Symbology files. **Ensure you only click `Load` before closing the menu.**

### Acknowledgment
